# bookingcourse-demo

Build a prototype website that allows to demonstrate how to book a course online. A friend wants to sell her language courses online and has asked you to create a small website that allows to test how her booking process would look and feel on mobile devices. 

You work alone and build a website consisting of one page with a course description, the booking form page and a confirmation page (a minimal of three pages). The booking form must validate user input and give feedback in case of invalid entry values. The site should look good on phones (mobile first) and on a desktop PC.

Plan, organize and build the website, using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5 and JavaScript. Create the mockup using Figma. Then use VS Code, Live Server, Git/GitHub for developing and source control.

Practice your Git/GitHub workflow with plenty of Commits and some Pull Requests + Merges.

Tipp: Apart from the usual main branch, use a development and feature branches.

Finish your project, including the retrospective, at 15:15 of the 29nd June 2023. At 15:30 there will be a vernissage of the works in the classroom.


TO DO: mobile query and JavaScript.
